\section{Reflection}
The internship period emphasized literature review, pipeline setup, and hypothesis formation. Feedback guided a shift from early cross-domain P300\textrightarrow{}SSVEP exploration toward a focused ITI-baseline, with clear next steps grounded in reproducible methods.

\section{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Limited test segments necessitate ITI-focused baselines and careful feature design.
	\item Verifying SSVEP/P300 components requires robust preprocessing and artifact handling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reproduce ITI-based behavior prediction methods and report baseline metrics (RT/accuracy).
	\item Execute SuS\textrightarrow{}CCD-ITI transfer training and assess gains over baseline.
	\item Extend to cross-subject generalization and explore psychopathology factor prediction (Challenge 2).
\end{itemize}
