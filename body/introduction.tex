\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}


Electroencephalography (EEG) has become a vital tool in neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and brain-computer interface (BCI) development. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp, capturing neural oscillations and providing insights into cognitive functions and neural disorders. Recent advancements have driven significant research into EEG-based motor imagery (MI), where individuals imagine movements without physical execution, creating distinctive EEG patterns that can be leveraged for control and communication purposes.


\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem-statement}


Despite extensive research, EEG-based MI classification faces critical challenges. Traditional supervised learning methods typically yield limited accuracy (around 50\%) due to high signal variability, noise, and individual differences among subjects. Additionally, the scarcity and high cost of obtaining labeled EEG data hinder the development of robust, generalizable classification models. Consequently, there is a clear need for innovative methodologies capable of enhancing accuracy and reliability while reducing reliance on labeled data.


\section{Solution Overview}
\label{sec:solution-overview}


To address these challenges, this project proposes the implementation of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques tailored specifically for EEG MI classification. SSL uses unlabeled data to learn meaningful representations through internally generated tasks (pretext tasks), significantly improving classification performance and robustness without extensive labeled datasets.
